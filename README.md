# SnailSVN Helper
Because the [original version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zlorn.snail-svn-helper) supported fewer commands, So we added some other necessary commands

this extension is base on [SnailSVN](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/snailsvn/id847259925) or [SnailSVNLite](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/snailsvn/id1063090543).



## how to use 
Right-click in the file content or right-click in the Explorer to see this shortcut menu. The commonly used update and commit commands are retained, while other commands are placed in the secondary menu


## notes
this exception only support MacOs and need intalled [SnailSVN](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/snailsvn/id847259925) or [SnailSVNLite](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/snailsvn/id1063090543).
